### Title: Introduction to Systems of Linear Equations and Matrices

#### Summary:

This week introduces the fundamental concepts of linear algebra, focusing on systems of linear equations and their relation to the language of mathematics. It begins by drawing an analogy between sentences (systems of sentences) and linear equations (systems of equations), demonstrating how both can convey information through their combination. It explains the types of systems - complete, redundant, and contradictory (singular and non-singular) - using simple animal color examples. The document transitions into defining linear equations, showcasing how equations can represent real-life scenarios like grocery shopping problems. It concludes with an introduction to matrices, emphasizing their importance in linear algebra for representing and analyzing systems of linear equations.

#### Table of Definitions and Concepts:

| Term | Definition | Keywords |
|------|------------|----------|
| Linear Equation | An equation that forms a straight line when graphed. It only involves linear terms and constant terms. | Equations, Linear |
| System of Linear Equations | A collection of one or more linear equations involving the same variables. | Systems, Equations |
| Singular System | A system of equations that does not have a unique solution (either no solution or infinitely many solutions). | Systems, Singular |
| Non-Singular System | A system of equations that has exactly one solution, making it the most informative. | Systems, Non-Singular |
| Matrix | A rectangular array of numbers or functions arranged in rows and columns that can represent a system of linear equations. | Matrices, Algebra |
| Determinant | A scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix and encodes certain properties of the matrix. | Matrices, Determinant |
| Linear Dependence | A situation where one vector in a set can be defined as a linear combination of the others. | Vectors, Dependence |
| Linear Independence | A condition where no vector in a set is a linear combination of the others, implying uniqueness in vector representation. | Vectors, Independence |

#### Glossary:

- **Complete System**: A system that contains as many pieces of information as sentences, implying a direct one-to-one correspondence between the number of equations and the amount of distinct information conveyed.
- **Redundant System**: A system where at least one equation does not provide new information but repeats or combines information from other equations in the system.
- **Contradictory System**: A system containing equations that offer conflicting information, making it impossible to find a solution that satisfies all equations simultaneously.
- **Rank of a System**: A measure indicating the maximum number of linearly independent equations within a system. Higher rank means less redundancy.
- **Visual Representation**: The practice of depicting systems of linear equations as geometric figures, such as lines or planes, to facilitate understanding of solutions and system properties.
- **NumPy Library**: A Python library used for numerical computing, particularly useful for operations involving arrays, matrices, and linear algebra.
